## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Java 17** or higher (recommended for JavaFX 17+)
* **[JavaFX SDK](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)** matching your Java version
* **Maven** (for building)

---

### Building

Clone the repository, then build the project with Maven:

```bash
  mvn clean package
```

This will produce a runnable JAR file in the `target/` directory.

---

### Running

**Important:**
JavaFX libraries are *not* bundled into the jar file by default due to licensing.
You must **download the JavaFX SDK** and add it to your Java classpath when running.

1. **Download** the JavaFX SDK for your platform from:
   [https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)

2. **Extract** the SDK somewhere on your system.

3. **Run the game** using the following command (update path as needed):

```bash
  java --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-XX/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar target/catan-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Replace `/path/to/javafx-sdk-XX/lib` with the actual path to your extracted JavaFX SDK.

---

### Developer Notes

* Make sure to set up your IDE to recognize JavaFX libraries for development and debugging.
* For packaging JavaFX inside the jar (not default), consider using Maven plugins like `javafx-maven-plugin` or `jlink`.
